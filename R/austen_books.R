#' Tidy data frame of Jane Austen's 6 completed, published novels
#' 
#' Returns a tidy data frame of Jane Austen's 6 completed, published novels with 
#' two columns: \code{text}, which contains the text of the novels divided into 
#' elements of up to about 70 characters each, and \code{book}, which contains the titles of
#' the novels as a factor in order of publication.
#' 
#' @details Users should be aware that there are some differences in usage 
#' between the novels as made available by Project Gutenberg. For example, 
#' "anything" vs. "any thing", "Mr" vs. "Mr.", and using underscores vs. all 
#' caps to indicate italics/emphasis.
